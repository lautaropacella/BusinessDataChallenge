Dee 925;"I live on Ground Floor. Directly off a main road. For months now i have followed Housing Association protocol to report a repair, via emaol service, both via website and directly.

Friday evening some man was break-in through gate; The fright and PTSD this has caused, is just unfathomable.

Contacted Housing Association with CAD number first thing this morning; only response so far  from Maintenance Surveyor stating: “will have a look into”. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

Anne-Marie;"When are housing organisations like this one going to start taking responsibility for the extremely poor services and maintenance they're providing? Reported glass front wardrobe as needing replacing or repairs back in 2012, now 2019 2 jobs 2 grand children later, I'm still reporting the  dangerous condition. The have sent no fewer than 6 ppl (including their surveyor twice) to look at it, yes look at it! Take photos, make an appointment then don't show up my boiler installed over year ago, marked my wall with pen & solder, and left piping exposed and unboxed, but other tenants have been, why? Some came on 07/02/19, yes! you guest it, they looked at it and left to make another appointment for 04/03/19.  The list goes on. My dilemma; I have no more holidays to book off for appointments they do not attend. No what? I have a list of Housing Associations shoddy customer and maintenance service but will share another time. There is no accountability in organisation like this, people aren't happy but they don't care because we're are only tenants, if I was a lease holder what hoops would they not jump through for me I thinking about going to the councillors but no point, I'm not a lease holder, rich, or a mate so that's pretty much a waste of my time. I believed the old systems which use to hold these types of organisations accountable are long gone that's why they can keep you on the phone for 30-45 mins waiting for someone to answer or answer and leave you hanging for 10 mins before saying the persons gone home. Accountability is what's missing in these organisations that's why they get away with falling short of their responsibilities. I'll keep posting, I'm finding it cathartic. No one is listening, so not to explode/ implode I think I'll write about my experiences & share with social media, after that rant I feel a sense of relief. I'll post about the paving stone incident on Facebook; also still pending after being looked at by the same surveyor twice, two contractors twice!!! And they get paid for looking."; 1 star 
Diana;People on river close are throwing rubbish and wood pieces from their homes but nobody does anything about it. Another week where rubbish is dumped on a road with a childrens play area next to it. Not hard to find the persons doing it but Housing Association doesn't bother and charges more service charges against people who are suffering during the pandemic.

Mohammed Khan;"WORST HOUSING ASSOCIATION
Let me paint a picture for you, imagine anyone being able to walk into your block of flats because Housing Association aren’t concerned about your safety. Imagine being trapped in a home where your own landlord won’t fix guttering leaking directly on to your front door. Imagine your neighbourhood officer being that much of a joey he blocks numbers of residents ( Arvin). Imagine a landlord that breaks GDPR by sending you someones rent statement. Imagine one of their garden workers urinating against the flat wall. Need I say more ?"; 1 star

I call them the customer service response after a long time of waiting, and they say they will call back to give to you an appointment and never call ... they hardly ever reply to your email, but it doesn't matter because they have no intention of fixing anything.

Thump_ ed;"Don't get yourself trapped in shared ownership with Housing Association, whilst some models may be aimed at helping people to move on - Housing Association seem to be content with having the property filled and collecting rent.  This goes up by 11% every year regardless, meaning we are now paying the market rate plus the mortgage payment on our share.  As a tenant you have rights, in a shared ownership property you don't - avoid.

I won't go on about all the problems from the past, but their inability to resolve ongoing issues (see the other reviews) demonstrates Housing Association just don't seem have the required level of capability to run the broad scope of their operation."; 1 star

Kaushik Sen;We bought a flat At one of your developments. Your sales manager Chris Holder is the most incompetent manager that we have seen. It has been 8 months and our communal energy accounts still not set, so we are all expecting a huge bill soon. You do not know how to keep your promises as time and again you miss sell information for which you should take responsibility but as always you don’t. You do not care about your customers and people like Chris Holder makes it worse. Your leadership team has no clue of what is going on and does not have any control over the team. Apartments were handed over 7-8 months late and no compensation was offered. You sales manager Chris Holder does not even know how to talk to customers who have paid premium price to buy in your development. We buy parking spaces and then other people parks in our space displaying names of Housing Association sales manager like Chris Holder saying that he has given permission. On being contacted Chris Holder does not even have time to resolve the issue or reply on time. It feels more like Housing Association is doing a favour. Just by changing logo id the attitude and the quality improved many leaders and organisations would have been successful. Definitely the wrong unethical people are working here. Leadership team because they are a part of larger housing association does not care about customers.; 1 star 
STARLITH JONES;Regards complaints of Anti-Social Behaviour of neighbours being of one and the same housing, we are suffering with noisy neighbours as they get their family who are not tenants staying in a 2 bedroom home with 2 kids who are screaming and crying so very loud at odd hours of the night and whenever we complain we just get an automated response  but they say the Officer in charge would get back but its been several months now since we got any response on the course of action taken and from the ongoing matter we can guess that there no sort of action implemented and that they just seem to ignore the matter.  Not fair as we are very good tenants paying all our rent & taxes properly and my husband goes to an early shift at around 3.00 am in the morning but yet noone ever cares a damn to looking into our matter with utmost consideration.  Only these people who are Somalian and who are always considered on sympathetic basis but not adhering to any housing laws or the Country laws.  We are so vexed with this situation.; 3 stars 
STARLITH JONES;"I am again writing another review about my housing Housing Association.  I must say they have improved in their repairs and maintenance issues with the New Contractors and from my experience, I am happy with this progress.
My issue though however is with the housing officers who need to do more for their tenants and be more considerate and take matters more seriously with dealing with noisy neighbours who are not even their tenants and who are visiting but sometimes staying on and during late hours of the night they disturb people who have to go an early shift like 3.00 am to start and wake up.  I have even several times mentioned about autistic son who is so much agitated with this noise nuisance but all they do is seem to ignore our feelings by only just acknowledging by saying we are sorry to hear this and we know how you feel and that they cannot do anything about this matter as it is for the Noise environment team to deal with it.  I even had been assaulted by those tenants' visitors but yet they just kept on having me on by saying that the officers were changed and so sorry that there was noone to take up the matter etc.  They just kept me hanging on for so long and to end with no resolution to my problem.
Those good old days and the standards of the housing are all gone and we can never get back such good service by such valuable officers who were so very good at their jobs. Very out reaching and really had aptitude of dealing with such matters.  They would be responding to our matters be it busy or not by even having the decency to tell us that they would get back to us as soon as they finish any work that they are busy about.  This is how they should treat tenants who are never defaulting I their rents nor having any sort of trouble with like adhering to the housing laws above all. This is grey issue to look into as they cannot simply ignore the tenant who has special needs and try to sympathise with the non tenants who seem to be crying children throughout the night with loud screaming nonstop cries."; 1 star

It's been very hard work for myself and family but with the help of Becky, Shelagh, Liz and all the rest of the team there we have finally got our beautiful 2 bed home. You all have been very helpful and understanding and to see my daughter running around the house and garden fills me with happiness.

Never try to leave for another help to buy property, we've been trying for 15 months and because we own this place everyone favours first time buyers. We now have the prospect of 3 of us living in a 1 bed house. I wish someone had told us this before we bought in!

I have reported a blocked kitchen sink  for 8 times over the last 3 weeks  with the  Housing Association Staff, and the repairs team and the contract Supervisor who promised to show up  twice and did not ,which is allowing the residue of waste of contaminated fluid to come back  up into the kitchen sink. This fluid is a reflux wastage fluid which is very dangerous and contains legionare disease in the wastage system  .

I have had to manually sythone this contaminated water out of our kitchen sink with a towel, every 2 hours as the reflux of this fluid keeps filling up and flooding the sink and floor area. I have had to adjust my schedule and my personal life to be able to deal with this issue. Cleaning up every 2 hours coming up to 3 weeks now

We also have a further issue with the hot water and Central heating system which is also not working!!
We were  assured that someone will attend today 4/3/19 to assist with these repairs ; again no response!,,
It it now yet again 17.00 Monday 4/3/2019 and yet again no response from anybody

Now I am not one for complaining, but I have to say something, because this whole thing is humanely unacceptable.

Bak Zani;"Cheap materials used to build house.

I have had an ongoing issue with Housing Association Housing for the breakdown of my Boiler, it is an issue that has gone on for 2 years. We have been told by multiple engineers that they had advised Housing Association that the boiler needs replacing and is not repairable due to the poor quality of the boiler in which they first used to build the houses.

The Problem with boiler was that it would not hold any hot water. So as soon as the water would heat up the boiler would then dump it because it would over heat. Therefore every time the boiler would use energy to heat up water, it would then dump it.

This caused high bills as energy to fill up the whole boiler was being used, but the hot water would only remain in the boiler for a couple of hours and not for a day or two as advised by engineers who would visit to try and fix it.

The response from Housing Association has been extremely poor, even though multiple engineers would come to try and fix the problem and then report back to Housing Association that a new boiler is needed, they did not replace the boiler they were responsible for. Housing Association was aware of the defective boilers as they were advised multiple times by the engineers who visited and they also had replaced a same make boiler couple houses down form ours.

They only change the boiler when elements under the boiler were getting wet due to the leaking of the boiler which had also been going on for a long period of time. It is only when an electrician came and told us to change the boiler as a matter of an emergency because it was dangerous as we also had a baby at the house.

We had also arranged an appointment with an engineer from SSE to come and see why he had such high usage and his conclusion was that the boiler was taking up an outrages amount of energy. Furthermore, SSE have sent you a breakdown of how much energy was being used before and after the boiler was broken and that shows double the usage of energy whilst the boiler was broken.

Now Housing Association have refused to make a contribution towards the electricity bill as somehow whole boilers of hot water being dumped, then heating up water again and that happening every time we would need hot water doesn’t contribute to high electrical usage.

We also have a half hanging fence in the back garden with a two year old in the house. We have been told not to let him in the garden, about a year ago. Still they have not come to fix it."; 1 star

Nazanin Kazemi;"Government housing scheme feeding property giants with young buyers
Dear Sir/Madam,
I'd like to take your attention to a problem which many young people are struggling with. A problem which is started by a government scheme without any sort of control on it where buyers took park in Shared-Ownership scheme (promoted by government) and then as soon as the purchase was done they were left alone to face all the discrimination and misbehaviour from the property giants they've been dealing with.
Below is a summary of one of the issues we are dealing with. I'd like to write more about it and inform more people about the different situations which are being forced to us.
We've purchased a shared ownership flat from Housing Association Housing in Beaufort Park (NW9) which is developed by St George. The development is started about 10 years ago and still on going and the uncalculated amount of development is causing lots of conflict of interests in the area. As a young couple 3 years ago we decided to go ahead with this government scheme and purchase a shared ownership flat but now we are facing more and more discrimination towards us from St George. I believe St George is permitted to build this development on the condition of assigning a part of their development to Shared Ownership buyers and they've taken it as a force from government and in return they are putting the shared owners in a corner and by not providing services to us had made our life very difficult.
We had a number of issues which I can explain later but in their latest action St George is taking away our parking spaces to give it to their customers. We have paid for these spaces and are paying an annual fee for it but because St George is building another block next to us which is for their customers (Not shared ownership) they are now taking our parking spaces to give it to their new customers.
The parking spaces are below our flats (under building) and I don't see anyone more eligible than us to use them. I find it very offensive when St George is claiming our parking spaces were allocated to us on Goodwill Gesture. We are not living in a homeless shelter or a charity venue and paying mortgage and rent for our properties but they are treating us as unwanted residents who were forced to their development.
I believe this need to be publicised so more people now about it and don't fall in the trap of shared ownership.

What 'is' repaired usually breaks again (our lifts are constantly out of service). We are overcharged ridiculous amounts (£300 to remove a sign). They do botch jobs (fire safety signs were removed on every floor and 4 holes were left behind never filled or repainted... the wrong paint was used in the corridors to cover filler leaving walls 'striped' every few metres on all floors, we've had leaks in various windows around the building that have not been fixed for years even though water gushes in when it rains). Even 'easy' jobs are left for maddening amounts of time (the entry phone was broken for 12 months until residents had to contact the CEO of Housing Association to get it done).... And I could give dozens of other examples. It is a disgrace of an organization that takes money from both the government and residents alike and leaves us to live with it.; 1 star

Renting a market-rent property from Housing Association in South West London since 2010.

Advantages:
* Great central location
* Excellent transport links
* Two nice neighbours

Disadvantages:
Just a few of the issues encountered over the years:
*Building built in 1800s - no cyclical  maintenance at all, just reactive repairs
*Thankfully I have good neighbours - but there are some very weird tenants & some outright dangerous ones (murder in 2014). There are also families and professionals, must the latter tend to leave after a couple of years, once they see what the place is really like
*Squatters
*Rats in communal areas
*Had a good caretaker until two years ago - new caretaker basically doing nothing all day, no cleaning of communal areas
*Due to Victorian drains and neighbours throwing grease down their kitchen sink, toilet doesn't drain every couple of months - hours of work lost over the years waiting for repairs. They won't invest in a new drainage system. Thankfully the drainage sub-contractor Advanced Drains are very good - I know all their workers by name now, as I've basically met all of them multiple times over the years :/
*Paying £1000 in rent for a tiny one-bed flat
*Ineffective layout - corridor, small living room, corridor, kitchen, bedroom. So to get to the bedroom you have to go through the living room
*Finally they've started major refurbisment works recently - received two letters on these. One around May 2018 saying the works would start in July (they didn't). Another in December 2018 saying the works would start soon and the contractor would be in touch (they haven't been). Then suddenly on 3rd January 2019, cowboy scaffolders turned up with no warning from the landlord or the contractor
*They won't decant tenants despite needing to refurbish kitchens and bathrooms. No Housing Association project managers or responsible persons to speak to other than the call centre staff who obviously aren't very informed and keep transferring you from one department to another
*Vehicle gate always open, so basically anyone can come & go - which means random people park their cars in the residents' parking lot
*Two abandoned cars in the residents' parking lot being used by squatters and drug dealers for about the last year. Police are monitoring but nothing concrete being done
*Windows and doors not double-glazed and have ineffective sealants, so very cold in winter and expensive to heat
*People parking their motorbikes in fron of our front door
*Fly-tipping in the parking lot
*Anti-social behaviour in the parking lot especially in summer - preventing people sleeping and making them feel unsafe
*Trespassers last year due to main building door lock being continuously out of order for months and months - despite continuous calls to repair call centre and multiple attendances by the maintenance contractor Axis.

If I could go back in time, I never would have rented here.

It's like living in a slum, and paying £1000.00 per month in rent for the privilege."; 1 star 
James Parker;The don’t deserve a single star if we are being honest. They hired builders that would take pictures of us, perving over a female flat meme we of ours.

Did ask the office to send me the bills, as I wanted to view and verify the overpayment of funds. The office till date haven't sent me the bills but have instead posted a letter mentioning that if the payment wasn't made by the deadline, this matter would be escalated to county court. It's difficult to understand how they function. They demand the money without providing any evidence. Invoices have been requested but till date we haven't received them. Over the past few days we hav been calling the office and have emailed them to get this matter resolved but they keep ignoring our request.They have the nerve to contact our mortgage lender but will notact us directly.

They have prevented me getting help from citizens advice and their ex employee now works for Plumstead law center and is helping them destroy me having stolen my identity. UPDATE: they are still at it. They've harassed me near to death (evidence available) to rob me of yet another Christmas. I'm on pills now. I can't deal with it any longer.

george wakefield;Awful customer service. Terrible company and terrible staff. Absolute joke of a company. I dealt with Kevin whilst selling my property, this turned out to be 6 months of agony. There was constant miscommunication and losing of important documents which severely slowed the process down. When being promised call backs, they did not call and when you called there were levels of hostility from staff. When reacting to their rudeness, the call was threatened to be terminated even though I remained calm. They do not like criticism and selling my house through them has been an awful experience and I would not recommend.; 1 star

Moved to the UK 3 months ago and had no hot water in my flat for last two months. This has been a HUGE cultural shock for me to learn (from every one who moved here) that the UK only has incompetent landlords like Housing Association.

I have worked in few developing countries in where NOTHING works but the same struggle for a private apartment in one digit post code in central London is quite a shocker.

Problems about dealing with Housing Association for your housing disrepairs are that there is not a single person in organization in charge of your case. They don't generate case reference number either, so 1 in 3 helpline operators can't locate your case which results you being end up explaining everything about the past months to one of hundreds of operators at the helpline desk over the phone. And you NEVER get to speak to their managers and your only contact point at Housing Association is these hundreds of operators (each time different) who know almost nothing about your technical issues. All they can do is to take a memo, so that someone else (in higher hierarchy?) takes a look and give them a decision for the next step, but what if they don't get your problem? You tell them your house is on fire, and they type ""She needs a dentist"" instead of firefighters? So, that's basically what you have to deal with Housing Association on every single call.

Here are the details if you care to read ;

They always tell you that they can't get hold of the person at Asset Management Department (AMD) who is ""supposed to be looking after your case"", so they leave a memo to AMD to call you back but they NEVER do, for months even each calls to the operators at helpline they leaves same memo over and over again to AMD. Some sympathetic operator did an employee search for me about the person from AMD they are internally trying to get hold of for a month, result: this person is not on the employee list. I asked her to do the search for other neighbourhood manager's name we were given before, nope, this person is also not on the list of Housing Association employee either.

So you see, they ""have"" a person who are supposed to be in charge whom no one in the organisation can get hold of. All you will be told for months is to wait for a call from the person who probably doesn't even exist anymore??

In the mean while they assign you numbers of their out-sourced contractors without listening to your needs so they send you wrong guys each time to waste your time. Over the past one month they assigned Mia Gas to send us a gas engineer to our electric boiler problem. He left saying there is nothing he can do. Few weeks later they assigned a company called Axis to send an electric engineer when we specifically asked to send a plumber. Same, he came and said there is nothing he can do, he left. Finally, they send a plumber but again, they sent a wrong plumber to the issues that are not owned by them so he left saying their company is not allowed to touch the issue.

Housing Association and these contractors have no effective means of communication other than sending emails. They don't communicate so messages get lost. Housing Association sends ""We need an apple"" and the other end receives ""They need a banana"", so their IT system is also totally f*cked up and no one cares to look at it.

They merged with Family Mosaic in 2017 back then people protested for the mergers for two already too-big companies. They became too distant from their customers and everyone you speak tells you different things, provides you different (and wrong) diagnoses, and no one owns responsibilities. This is why your housing disrepair goes no where...

LAST BUT NOT LEAST, we are not even asking them to fix our boiler. We hired plumber company separately two month ago and all we want is to get a person in charge of the apartment structure to speak to our plumbers so they can continue their work!

I can only imagine what's like to ask Housing Association to do the actual fixing of your problem"; 1 star

Emma Tarrant;Just another greedy corporation who have totally lost their original ethos.Lived in a market rent property of theirs but they increased the rent by 9 percent every November for 3 years in a row (27% in 24 month period) pushing us out of our home. They also wouldn't pay for any decoration to the property, despite it being in a below average state when we moved in.We painted and cleaned the carpets out of our own pocket. Repairs were to a very bad standard (after the usual struggle to speak to a member of their team) and they couldn't even fix a smoke alarm. Would never consider Housing Association for a property in the future.; 1 star 
Ahmed Sabir;"My name is Fabiha and I am a tenant of Housing Association.
I am appalled by their service and quality of their homes.
I have suffered months with mould in the property.
And for the last 1 month my home has been infested by foreign grain beatles which lives of moulds, has been indentified by the pest control who can not resolve this issue as it requires more than just pest control.
Bearing in mind I have a 3 year old child in this property and no one is addressing my issue.
The infestation is so bad I have found these beatle in our food and in my daughters nappy and of course its all over the house too coming out of every cracks and corners of the home to a point i find these in our  bed too(I have all video and images for proof). Housing Association has been really unhelpful with our issue and issue has still not beed resolved its been a month now, I have been living in this state. I cannot function on a day to day basis and this has disrupted the stability of my life along with my child.  My mental wellbeing has taken a drastic fall and this issue has taking far too long to resolve.

And to think people actually buy these homes !? Made with poor quality matireals which only looks good on the outside!
If this can happen to me and my family,  how many other households have Housing Association been negligent to?

I reccomend anyone who wants to move into or buy Housing Association home should avoid at all cost. Its disgusting and appalling on how cheap matireal is used to build these home and how much suffering is caused in the long run."; 1 star

Daniel Green;"To Whom this may Concern.

I am complaining about a on going repair that has not been taken out or done to a good standard.

I have made gallions(Housing Associations)aware and also axis who work on behalf of gallions.

I have a leak into my kitchen area and has been ongoing for 2 years in total. I have made all revellvent party's aware and also my landlord housing association.

The leak I do belive is hazardous to my health and is affecting my every day life and is causing a great deal of frustration whilst indoors in my property. The leak has caused a great deal of damage to the decor of my property and I do believe the leak to be coming from the waste stool pipe that is behind the plasterboard and can be seen all over affecting my ceiling. I have raised my concerns and feel it concerns me greater more so as I also have my family and two children that attend my property. It is a big health risk so would kindly appreciate that my concerns can now be acknowledged and taken seriously and that I can get my property back to suitable living conditions.

I would like for you to check with your records as you will see this has been ongoing with not a great deal of concern from your behalf nor acting as proffesional agents.

I have had an uncompitant worksman at my property around 22nd September 2015 that was unable to  carry out a repair because he had only came with his paint brushes and paint tins. And had left my property in a very bad state.

I then raised a complaint to gallions and axis again and at the same time and was confronted by an aggressive lady from axis office over the phone. I am know concerned as to Whom I may raise my concerns to and have also had to contact my local council.

I would greatly appreciate any reply back as to what steps will be taken and if we could all just work together to resolve these issues.

Please get in contact as my complaints is again logged by email on 14/03/2016

Regards Daniel Green

Please could I forward some more information on as I have not received any reply from my association instead received a rent arrears statement for which I am not in arrears.

To whom this may concern.

Please could you advise me as to my rights  concerning silica dust as I have more concerns.

My property is a first floor flat property affected by silica dust from construction work carried out back in 2014.

I do appreciate and understand work must be carried out for the new project and development of this local area but would like to raise my concerns as to how much dust from the debris is circulating through the air into my property and potentially could be causing difficulties to my health.

I seem to have aqquired some kind of allergy caused from the silica dust that has been affecting my property for the past two years and as to where my health has taken a down hill turn which seem to be leaving me suffering from long term cold like and allergy symtoms.

Please could you advise me my rights or the correct party to contact as this is my first point of contact regarding my concerns.

I am raising concerns.

As to the time the project is taking leaving the site in a way of feeling discarded.

And to how local residents including myself should be subject to live next to this pile of debris that currently still lays abandoned affecting the local area and the peoples health.

This is mostly affected on the bright  windy days so would like to point out oppretives should of been keeping regular checks to this site and keeping dust levels to a low following to the HSE rules and regulations and regularly wetting down the area to avoid affecting local residents.

Research suggest that silica dust is a great danger to one's health and have been linked to silicosis COPD or even carcinogenic so please understand my concerns I am raising.

Please see attached photos.
